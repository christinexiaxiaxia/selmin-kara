						<a href="https://vimeo.com/123253559" target="_blank">“Transmissions from the Technological Sublime”</a>
						A video completed as part of Michael Trommer’s MFA project. Intended as a large-scale, panoramic audio-visual installation. Sound is disseminated via 6 regular channels (hexagonal array) + 1 subwoofer (center/front). Original video is 5760 x 1080 dpi, to be projected via 3 synchronized HD projectors.

						A peer-reviewed article authored by Treva Pullen, based on ongoing research from her master’s thesis. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://vimeo.com/65470870" target="_blank">“Dissolving Self: Wearable Technology + Contemporary Dance”</a>
						A playformance piece that is part of Maziar Ghaderi’s Masters in Design research, Playformance. “Dissolving Self” employs metaphoric data visualization, motion capture and wearable technology to harness the subtle movements of a contemporary dancer. A gyroscope and a radio module (Xbee) worn by the dancer measure and transmit speed of rotation and a Microsoft Kinect captures lateral movement. These two sets of live data are fed into Processing, an open source software to create a responsive and metaphoric visualization that is projected over the dancer.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://vimeo.com/92749306" target="_blank">“Jadoo Banoo: Leap Motion X Poetry”</a>
						A customized networked-performance that is part of Maziar Ghaderi’s Masters in Design research, Playformance. Ghaderi animated and projected the words of Jadoo Banoo’s poem on and across the stage. The disorderly path of the words was formed by the hand gestures captured over the Leap Motion and the font size was determined by the speed of the gestures. Jadoo Banoo uses the performer’s spontaneous movements as embodied acts of articulation to translate spoken poetry and explores how the performer spatially interacts with and within the virtual representation of her own poetic text.

						<li>
						Culture Shifts is a documentary screening series co-organized by Selmin Kara, Min Sook Lee, Richard Fung, and Ryan Rice. It presents documentary media as a catalyst for critical discussions and community action for social change.

						<a href="https://propriomedia.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><h3>ProprioMedia Colloquium Series</h3></a>
					</li>
						<li>
							“ProprioMedia Colloquium Series”, which ran between 2013–2016, was a speaker series organized by Selmin Kara and David McIntosh at OCAD University. Its goal was to establish a dialogue among scholars working in various fields related to or intersecting with media studies and research at OCAD University and select institutions in North America. The colloquia took place monthly and featured 2–3 speakers, delivering 25–30 minute presentations, followed by a Q&A. 
							Meaning behind the title: “ProprioMedia” is a coined concept invoking the associations of the Latin term proprius—meaning “one’s own,” “proper,” or “individual,”—in the larger context of media theory and practice. Proprioception as a bodily basis for spatial and multi-sensory consciousness has been a source of rising interest in new media and film-related research in recent years but one can also think about the significance of proprietary thinking for understanding how various media practices relate to the self as well as the collective through the individual. It also refers to the “characteristic,” that is to say, the particular and the distinguishing, underscoring the series’ openness to innovative research that encompasses a wide range of topics.
